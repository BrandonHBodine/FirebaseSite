      <h3>Positioning and Floats: A life long struggle.</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This might just be the first blog post I have ever written. It will probably be riddled with grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and, in general, bad ideas.</p>

      <p>CSS is my least favorite part of programming. It’s the lack of consistency it offers that often throw me off to a long path of confusion and spurts of apathy.The interactions are usually not as straightforward as I would like them to be and I just
        haven’t taken the time to learn the right way with all the tools available that have made decent looking design available in seconds. With that being said, there is no better time than now to learn. And by now I mean this weekend. I have been
        having a tough time at work with some navigation menus functioning the way I would like them too. The site is using bootstrap and with that I could simply ignore most of the css but every so often there comes up something where you have to dive
        in a fix it from the ground up.</p>

      <p> I have started to comb over a few articles about the position property and definitely learned a few things about the most confusing parts of the property. There are five different values that can be used, each with their own unique ways of messing
        with your head.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Static - This is the default value of elements but since elements act differently this could mean that static will be different depending on the element.</li>
        <li>Relative- </li>
        <li>Absolute- </li>
        <li>Fixed- </li>
        <li>Sticky- </li>
      </ul>
